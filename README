== Intro ==

serial-latency-test measures the roundtrip time of packets sent over
the serial port. It calculates the worst case roundtrip time of all
sent packets and displays a histogram of the rountrip time jitter.

== Compile, install and run ==

See https://github.com/koppi/serial-latency-test/wiki

Run serial-latency-test as follows:

 $ serial-latency-test -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600

   This runs the benchmark on the given serial port with the given baud rate.
   Note, that the RX and TX have to be connected using a cable in the real
   hardware to loop the sent packets back.

This is an early release. Please report bugs to the authors.
