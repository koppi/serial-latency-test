== Intro ==

serial-latency-test measures the roundtrip time of packets sent over
the serial port. It calculates the worst case roundtrip time of all
sent packets and displays a histogram of the rountrip time jitter.

== Compile, install and run (Debian/Ubuntu) ==

The following libraries are required to build serial-latency-test:

 * debhelper (>= 5)
 * autotools-dev
 * automake

Compile and install serial-latency-test as follows:

 $ sh autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

Run serial-latency-test as follows:

 $ serial-latency-test -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600

   This runs the benchmark on the given serial port with the given baud rate.
   Note, that the RX and TX have to be connected using a cable in the real
   hardware to loop the sent packets back.

== Cross-compile and run (mingw32/wine) ==

 $ sudo apt-get -y install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime
 $ ./configure --build=i686-linux --host=i586-mingw32msvc
 $ sudo apt-get -y install wine
 $ mkdir -p ~/.wine/dosdevices & cd ~/.wine/dosdevices
 $ ln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 com1
 $ wine serial-latency-test.exe -p COM1: -b 9600

== Authors ==

This is an early release. Please report bugs to the authors.
